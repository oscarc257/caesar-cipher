Description:

Caesar's Cipher Project

Content:

This project involves creating a basic encryption and decryption system using JavaScript. Also, implementing additional features like adding random letters to maintain encryption and decryption symmetry.

Features:

Improved Error Handling: Correctly adjusted the conditions in both encryption and decryption functions to check if the index of the letter in the alphabet is -1 (indicating it's not found).

Decryption Logic: In the decryption logic adjusted the modulus calculation to handle negative values correctly. This ensures proper wrapping around the alphabet during decryption.

Random Letter Function: This function generates a random letter from the alphabet, which you use to maintain the encryption by adding a random letter after every second encrypted letter.

Testing: Tested both encryption and decryption with a provided message and verified that they work as expected.

Code Clarity: Comments were added throughout project, making it easier to understand the purpose of each function and the logic behind them.
